neural-net-from-scratch takes 4 arguments at the command line:
-training file (flat file)
-test file (flat file)
-learning rate (alpha)
-number of iterations

Number of iterations can be greater than the number of training instances in a file. The program will simply just train from the beginning of the file keeping the learned sigmoid.
